\title{Pairwise Jaccard Coefficients}
\usage{
jaccardTopics(topics, limit.rel = 1/200, limit.abs = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{topics}{[\code{named matrix}]\cr
The counts of vocabularies (row wise) in topics (column wise).}

\item{limit.rel}{[0,1]\cr
A relative lower bound limit for which words are taken into account. All words
are taken as relevant for a topic that have a count higher than \code{limit.rel}
multiplied by the total count of the given topic.}

\item{limit.abs}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
An absolute lower bound limit for which words are taken into account. All words
are taken as relevant for a topic that have a count higher than \code{limit.abs}.}
}
\value{
[\code{lower triangular named matrix}] with all pairwise jaccard similarities
of the given topics.
}
\description{
Calculates the similarity of all pairwise topic combinations using a modified
Jaccard Coefficient.
